# About specialization (x3 courses)
- Throughout the courses, we will be focusing on applications of AI that are most likely to support progress in areas like: environment, health, justice, and humanitarian action
- In the course, we'll highlight projects that aim to prevent, mitigate, or resolve problems that adversely affect human life or the environment
- You'll be looking at a variety of different case studies, and applying a framework to think through the required components of designing and developing a solution towards a particular problem and how AI may or may not add value as part of that solution.
- Course 1:
    - as you get familiar with what AI is and how it can be used to address real world problems, I'll introduce you to a framework for thinking through AI for good projects
- Course 2:
    - you will use AI to make wind energy forecasts. And in doing so, address the goal of making wind energy a more viable replacement for fossil fuels
- Course 3:
    - you'll look at how to manage resource allocation by doing automatic interpretation of text messages collected in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti

# Meaning of the title
- "AI for Good" = the application of AI, which is deliberately focused on addressing some of the biggest problems that we're seeing for our environment and for humanity today.

# More ideas
- If you're interested in thinking more about what kinds of problems there are to work on, then one really good place to look is the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
    - https://sdgs.un.org/goals
    - These goals include things like: reducing poverty and hunger, fighting climate change, reducing inequality, and promoting justice.
    - The UN goals are not without their own controversy and not everyone agrees with them 100%. But they are often useful as a common framework for discussion of goals among different parties working towards a better future.

# Do not harm
- You have to be cautious in considering the impact that AI could have, even with the best of intentions. It is often possible to do more harm than good. I'll suggest that you adopt a principal similar to the one used by many medical doctors around the world, namely the principle of "do no harm."
- "do no harm" = means that everyone impacted by the project is left better off, or at least unharmed
